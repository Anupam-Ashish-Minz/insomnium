## Backstory

Insomnium is a fork of [Kong/Insomnia at 2023.5.8](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnia), the last commit before compulsory account login was introduced. In a sense, Insomnium is a community response to [the latest product update that forces account creation w/o warning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37680522).

![HN](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/blob/main/hn.png?raw=true)

I was among the users who were deeply affected by the recent change. I still think Insomnia is a nice product in general, but I have to disagree with the direction it is going. So I have decided to fork it and make it 100% local and privacy-focus.

## Roadmap

I have removed user login, tracking, analytics, etc, from Insomnia so it is now a 100% local app. I will be cleaning up the code to make the UI faster, and refactor the local database and config to keep everything lean.

Next, we launch a Code Llama plugin for Insomnium, to make it more easily customizable and extensible while keeping the core product fast and 100% local and privacy-focus.
